# System Patterns

## System Architecture
PredictBet is built using a modular architecture with the following key components:
1. **Next.js Framework**: Provides server-side rendering and static site generation for optimal performance.
2. **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and improves code maintainability.
3. **Tailwind CSS**: Enables rapid UI development with utility-first styling.
4. **Radix UI Components**: Offers accessible and reusable UI elements.

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Framework Choice**: Next.js was chosen for its performance benefits and developer-friendly features.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS was selected for its flexibility and ease of use.
- **UI Components**: Radix UI components were integrated to ensure accessibility and consistency.
- **TypeScript**: Adopted to reduce runtime errors and improve developer productivity.

## Design Patterns
1. **Component-Based Design**: The application is structured around reusable and modular components.
2. **State Management**: Local state is managed using React hooks, with potential for global state management if needed.
3. **Responsive Design**: Ensures the application is accessible on various devices and screen sizes.

## Component Relationships
- **UI Components**: Located in `components/ui/`, these are reusable building blocks for the application.
- **Feature Components**: Found in `components/`, these implement specific features like data visualization and search.
- **Pages**: Defined in the `app/` directory, these represent the main routes of the application.
- **Utilities**: Utility functions and configurations are stored in the `lib/` directory.
