## CSV File Integration

### Current Focus
The `scrape_ufc_stats` module's CSV files are being integrated into the PredictBet system to enhance data visualization, search capabilities, and predictive modeling. These files include:
- **Event Data**: `ufc_event_details.csv` for metadata about UFC events.
- **Fighter Data**: `ufc_fighter_details.csv` and `ufc_fighter_tott.csv` for detailed fighter profiles.
- **Fight Data**: `ufc_fight_details.csv`, `ufc_fight_results.csv`, and `ufc_fight_stats.csv` for fight outcomes and statistics.

### Next Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensure the CSV files are free of inconsistencies and missing values.
2. **Integration Testing**: Validate the integration of these files with the data visualization and search components.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the data pipeline for faster processing and loading times.

### Active Considerations
- **Scalability**: Ensure the system can handle an increasing volume of data as new events and fighters are added.
- **Accuracy**: Maintain the accuracy of data during scraping and integration.
- **User Experience**: Present the data in a clear and intuitive manner to end-users.
