# Progress

## Current Status
The PredictBet project is in active development. The foundational setup is complete, and work is ongoing to implement core features.

## What Works
- **Framework Setup**: Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS are fully integrated.
- **UI Components**: Radix UI components are functional and styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **Routing**: Basic routing and layout structure are in place.
- **Fighter Profiles**: Initial integration with real UFC fighter data:
  - CSV data processing utility with TypeScript support
  - Fighter data service with caching and error handling
  - Real-time data loading with loading states
  - Error handling for data fetching issues
  - Basic fighter information display (height, weight, reach, stance)
  - Placeholder data for fight records and statistics

## What's Left to Build
1. **Fighter Data Integration**:
   - Integrate fight records from ufc_fight_results.csv
   - Add performance statistics from ufc_fight_stats.csv
   - Include detailed fighter information from ufc_fighter_details.csv
   - Implement data caching strategy for improved performance

2. **Data Visualization Tools**: 
   - Develop interactive charts and graphs for UFC stats
   - Create visualizations for fighter comparisons
   - Implement trend analysis for fighter performance

3. **Enhanced Search**: 
   - Implement advanced search functionality for fighter profiles
   - Add filters for weight classes, records, and fight outcomes
   - Create search suggestions and autocomplete

4. **Sentiment Analysis**: 
   - Integrate sentiment analysis charts
   - Connect social feeds
   - Implement real-time sentiment tracking

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Ensure fast loading times and smooth interactions
   - Optimize CSV data processing
   - Implement efficient data caching strategies

## Known Issues
- **Accessibility**: Some components need further testing to ensure full accessibility compliance.
- **Scalability**: The application architecture needs to be reviewed for handling a larger user base.
- **Styling Consistency**: Minor inconsistencies in component styling need to be addressed.
- **Data Integration**: 
  - Currently using placeholder data for fight records and statistics
  - Need to implement proper error handling for missing data
  - CSV parsing performance needs optimization for larger datasets
