# Next Steps Plan

## Overview
With the integration of UFC data from the `scrape_ufc_stats` module, the PredictBet project is positioned to leverage this data for enhanced features and predictive insights. This document outlines the next steps based on the current state of the memory bank.

## Immediate Priorities
1. **Data Cleaning and Validation**:
   - Ensure all CSV files are free of inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues.
   - Validate the accuracy of scraped data against official UFC sources.

2. **Data Integration**:
   - Connect the CSV files to the data visualization components for real-time chart generation.
   - Integrate fighter profiles and event details into the enhanced search functionality.

3. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Begin preprocessing the fight statistics for machine learning models.
   - Develop a prototype predictive model using historical fight data.

## Mid-Term Goals
1. **Feature Development**:
   - Build interactive comparison tools for fighter stats.
   - Implement sentiment analysis charts using social media data.

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize the data pipeline for faster processing and loading times.
   - Ensure scalability to handle increasing data volume and user traffic.

3. **Accessibility Enhancements**:
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure compliance with accessibility standards.
   - Address any remaining styling inconsistencies in UI components.

## Long-Term Vision
1. **Community Engagement**:
   - Integrate social feeds to foster community interaction.
   - Develop features that allow users to share insights and predictions.

2. **Advanced Predictive Insights**:
   - Expand the predictive model to include betting odds and sentiment analysis.
   - Use neural networks for complex pattern recognition in large datasets.

3. **Scalability and Maintenance**:
   - Review the application architecture to ensure it can handle a growing user base.
   - Establish a regular update mechanism for UFC data scraping.

## Active Considerations
- **Accuracy**: Maintain high data accuracy during scraping and integration.
- **User Experience**: Ensure features are intuitive and engaging for end-users.
- **Scalability**: Plan for future growth in data volume and user traffic.

## Next Steps
1. Assign tasks for data cleaning and validation.
2. Begin integration testing for data visualization and search features.
3. Prototype the predictive model using historical fight data.
